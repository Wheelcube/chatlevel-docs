## ChatLevel Trigger Node

The ChatLevel Trigger node listens for events from ChatLevel via webhooks. Each event type outputs to its own dedicated branch.

### Event Branches

The trigger node provides **10 output branches**, one for each event type:

| Branch Output    | Event Name           | Description                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Call**         | `call`               | Incoming or outgoing call detected |
| **Auth**         | `connection.auth`    | Device authentication successful   |
| **Closed**       | `connection.closed`  | Connection closed                  |
| **Logout**       | `connection.logout`  | Device logged out                  |
| **Open**         | `connection.open`    | Connection established             |
| **Timeout**      | `connection.timeout` | Connection timed out               |
| **Msg Deleted**  | `message.deleted`    | Message deleted                    |
| **Msg Received** | `message.received`   | Message received                   |
| **Msg Sent**     | `message.sent`       | Message sent                       |
| **Msg Updated**  | `message.updated`    | Message updated                    |

### Setup Guide

1. **Add Trigger Node** - Add the ChatLevel Trigger node to your n8n workflow
2. **Copy Webhook URL** - Click the node to reveal and copy the Webhook URL
3. **Configure in ChatLevel**:
   - Go to **Integrations** → **Add Integration** → **n8n** in ChatLevel
   - Paste the webhook URL from step 2
   - In the **Integrations** tab, adjust which events you want to receive on your webhook
4. **Connect Branches** - Connect different nodes to different output branches to handle events separately

> **Info:** Events automatically route to the correct output branch. You can select specific events in ChatLevel's Integrations tab to reduce webhook traffic.

## Tips & Best Practices

**Phone Number Format** - Always use digits only with country code: `31612345678` (not `+31 6 12345678`)

**Device Selection** - Use "From List" when building workflows. Use "By ID" when device IDs are dynamic.

**Error Handling** - Enable "Continue on Fail" in node settings to prevent workflow stops on API errors.

**Media Messages** - Supported formats: PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP only. Maximum size: 10MB.

**Event Filtering** - Use ChatLevel's Integrations tab to select specific events and reduce webhook traffic.

**Multiple Devices** - Each trigger node can handle events from multiple devices. Use the `deviceId` field to identify the source device.

## Troubleshooting

**Webhooks Not Received**

- Verify webhook URL is configured correctly in ChatLevel's Integrations tab
- Ensure n8n instance is accessible from the internet
- Check device is connected and subscription is active
- Verify correct events are selected in ChatLevel's Integrations tab

**Device Not Connecting**

- Scan QR code within time limit or use pairing code
- Ensure device subscription status is "active"
- Try restarting the device
- Delete and recreate if issues persist

**Messages Not Sending**

- Verify recipient number format (digits only with country code)
- Check device status is "connected"
- Ensure active subscription
- For media: verify format (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP) and size (less than 10MB)
