1. Obtain your Typebot chatflow's **Start Chat URL**
1. Add the Typebot integration to your **Chatlevel account**
1. Link your **Typebot integration** to one of your devices

### 1. Getting your API Key from Typebot

Before you add the Typebot integration in Chatlevel, you should first obtain your **API Key** in your Typebot account.

Within **Typebot**, follow the below steps to obtain your **API Key**:

1. Navigate to your**dashboard** .
2. Click**Settings and Members** .
3. Click**My account** .
4. Click**Create**  under the**API tokens**  section.
5. Enter a name for the**API token** .
6. Click**Create**  token.
7. Copy the**API token**  displayed on screen.

You will need this token while setting up the Typebot integration in Chatlevel.

The steps you see might be slightly different depending on changes within Typebot. [Check the Typebot documentation for updates.](https://docs.typebot.io/api-reference/authentication)

### 2. Obtaining your Chatflow's Start Chat URL

In order for Chatlevel to know where to reach your **Typebot chatflow**, you need to obtain your chatflow's **Start Chat URL**.

Within **Typebot**, follow the below steps to obtain your **Start Chat URL**:

1. Navigate to the **chatflow** you want to use with Chatlevel
2. Click **Share** _(see screenshot below)_

   <img
     src="/images/Screenshot_share.png"
     alt="Screenshot Share"
     title="Screenshot"
     style={{ width:"43%" }}
   />
3. Click **API**
4. Copy the **Start Chat URL** _(see screenshot below)_

   <img
     src="/images/Screenshot_startchat.png"
     alt="Screenshot Start Chat"
     title="Screenshot"
     style={{ width:"37%" }}
   />

You will need this Start Chat URL while setting up the Typebot integration in Chatlevel.

### 3. Setting up the Typebot integration

Now that you have an API Key, we can add the **Typebot integration** to your Chatlevel account.

Within **Chatlevel**, follow the below steps to set up the **Typebot integration**:

1. Navigate to **integrations**
2. Click **Add integration**
3. Select **Typebot**
4. Assign a **name** to your Typebot integration
5. Insert the **Start Chat URL** _(see section 2)_
6. Under **Authorization**, add the **API Key** _(see section 1)_
   <Note>
   Ensure that you include the full API Key including Bearer, i.e. _Bearer xxxxyyyyzzzz_
   </Note>
8. Set the **maximum duration** of a session\
   <Note>
   Chatlevel ends sessions automatically based on Typebot's API response, but if users don't finish the full Chatflow, the session will end automatically after this duration.
   </Note>
9. Click **Create**

Your Typebot integration is now set up. You will now need to link it to one of your devices.

### 4. Link Typebot integration to a device

Once you have a Typebot integration set up, you need to link your integration to one of your devices.

Within **Chatlevel**, follow the below steps to link your **Typebot integration** to a device:

1. Navigate to **Devices**
2. For the device you want to link, click the **Integration dropdown** _(see screenshot below)_

   <img
     src="/images/Screenshot_integrationdropdown.png"
     alt="Screenshot Integration Dropdown"
     title="Screenshot"
     style={{ width:"40%" }}
   />
3. Select the **Typebot integration** you set up _(see section 3)_
4. Done!

You have now linked your Typebot chatflow to Chatlevel.

## Usage

When using Typebot in combination with Chatlevel, a few things should be noted.

1. Chatlevel's Typebot integration currently only supports sending **text**  **messages**. Images or other non-text messages will not be processed. We are introducing support for more message types soon.
2. Since Chatlevel allows you to integrate with normal WhatsApp accounts instead of WhatsApp Business Accounts, things like buttons are not available and will not work with Chatlevel. Normal WhatsApp accounts only support plain messages and media.\\

   <Tip>
     If your Typebot Chatflow requires a user to pick out of multiple options, number them with 1) 2) 3) etc. and ask the user to respond with one of these numbers. You can then use [Typebot Conditions](https://docs.typebot.io/editor/blocks/logic/condition) to check which option the user selected.
