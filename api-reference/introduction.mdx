## Base URL

The Chatlevel API is built on REST principles. All requests contain the following base URL:

```http
https://api.chatlevel.io
```

## Authentication

To authenticate you need to add an `Authorization` header with the contents of the header being your API Key. You can generate your API Key from within the Chatlevel app under the developers page.

```json
{
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer sk_123456789"
  }
}
```
